Instance : We can create multiple object from a class. Each object is called a instance.
Every instance can have different property(attributes).

State: Different attribute of an object refers to different state.
State can also refer to two objects doing something.

1) Example object1 has height 6cm while object2 has height of 7cm.
Both objects have different state in this case.

2) Example object1 is resting while object2 is playing in ground.
